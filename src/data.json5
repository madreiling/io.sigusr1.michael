Not art, but functional art requiring a balance of aesthetics, pragmatism, and effectiveness. Code has purpose, and although it is abstract and hidden away from view, a good craftsmen cultivates quality such that it is inherently apparent. You can “feel” quality when it's there, and that unconscious sense is what I strive for in my work. There is no substitute for attention to detail.",
                    "I believe creating quality code doesn’t come from being an expert in the latest fads, but from a solid foundation of principles alongside practice, experience, and never-ending passion. In my <a href='/resume.html'>résumé</a> you’ll find both incredible breadth and depth in the type of projects I’ve worked on and the technologies that I’ve used. I don’t shy away from something new or foreign, and from that, have become quite proficient at a large number of the main stream technologies in modern software engineering (including the latest fads), covering frontend, backend, and mobile. It is in this sense that I consider myself a true full-stack engineer. I can do it all and I do it well, either from scratch or from within an existing codebase.",
